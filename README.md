# PKGBUILDs for [Arch User Repository](https://aur.archlinux.org)

The repository is based on [this one](https://github.com/eli-schwartz/pkgbuilds)
maintained by [Eli Schwartz](https://github.com/eli-schwartz).
All the hooks, `aurpublish` and `setup.sh` scripts were taken from that
repository.
Thanks, Eli.
